# Skin Disease Classification model

This module expands the system's capabilities to perform multiclass classification, classifying different types of skin cancer lesions. The functionalities of this module include:
Data Preprocessing: Similar to the binary classification module, this module preprocesses the input medical images to improve the quality and diversity of the dataset specific to the multiclass classification task.
Model Training: The CNN-based model is trained to classify various types of skin cancer lesions, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc. The training process involves utilizing a labeled dataset specific to multiclass classification.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the multiclass classification model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, considering the accuracy and class-wise performance measures. Result Visualization: The predicted labels, confidence scores, and potentially the probability distribution over different classes are visualized to understand the model's performance in classifying
different types of skin cancer lesions.
